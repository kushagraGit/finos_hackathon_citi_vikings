## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kushagraGit/finos_hackathon_citi_vikings.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start

# Seed initial data
npm run seed
```

## Configuration

Configure the application using environment variables:

```env
# Server Configuration

```

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the Swagger documentation at:

```
http://localhost:8080/api-docs
```

Detailed documentation is available for:

-   [Health Check Documentation](./docs/health-check.md)
-   [User API Documentation](./docs/user-api.md)
-   [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md)

### Quick API Reference

```bash
# User endpoints
GET    /v1/users          # Get all users
POST   /v1/users          # Create user
GET    /v1/users/:email   # Get user by email
PATCH  /v1/users/:email   # Update user
DELETE /v1/users/:email   # Delete user
POST  /v1/users/initialize #Initialize users (Development only)

# Health check endpoints
GET    /v1/health         # Basic health check
GET    /v1/health/detailed # Detailed health status

#Application endpoints
POST  /api/v2/apps              #Create a new application
GET   /api/v2/apps              #Retrieve all application definitions
GET   /api/v2/apps/{appId}      #Retrieve an application definition by appId
PATCH  /api/v2/apps/{appId}     #Update an application by appId
DELETE /api/v2/apps/{appId}     #Delete an application by appId
POST  /api/v2/apps/search       #Search applications based on multiple criteria
POST  /api/v2/apps/initialize   #Initialize applications with sample data (Development only)
```

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in production mode.

```bash
npm start
```

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode with hot reload.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner.

```bash
npm test
```

### `npm run seed`

Seeds both users and applications data in development mode.

```bash
npm run seed
```

### `npm run seed:users`

Seeds only user data in development mode. This will create default users with the following data:

```bash
npm run seed:users
```

Example users created:

-   Vishal Gautam (Admin)
-   Kushagra Asthana
-   Yousuf Ejaz Ahmad

### `npm run seed:apps`

Seeds only application data in development mode. This will create default FDC3 applications:

```bash
npm run seed:apps
```

Example applications created:

-   FDC3 Workbench
-   Trading View
-   Market Data Terminal

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=8080
HOST=localhost
NODE_ENV=development # Options: development, production, test

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

## Development Notes

1. The seed commands are only available in development mode
2. Running in development mode (`npm run dev`) will automatically seed the data
3. Seed commands can be run multiple times safely (they check for duplicates)
4. Production mode disables seeding functionality
